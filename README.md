### Project Theme: Environmental Conservation, Disaster Resilience, and Climate Change

### Description:
#### HerAi is not just an ordinary waste bank. We are a waste bank that give a new knowledge to increase Indonesian awareness on waste segregation. We create an Android application that allows user to take a picture, predict the waste image and get the result between Organic, Recyclable, or Non-Recyclable. If it is a Recyclable waste, we offer user to sell their waste through our app. Otherwise, we ask users to seperate the waste between Organic and Non-Recyclable. Our goal is to reach SDG number 12 on Responsible Consumption and Production in Indonesia. Please support us to achieve this goal and bring back the real meaning behind a waste bank!
